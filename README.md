# log4cats-natchez

Integration between [log4cats](https://github.com/typelevel/log4cats) and [natchez](https://github.com/typelevel/natchez)
for distributed tracing support in your logging.

## log4cats-natchez

Attach log events generated by calling log4cats `Logger[F]` methods to a Natchez `Span[F]`. 

You would use this as the ambient `Logger[F]` or `LoggerFactory[F]` in your application.
Interact with it as you would with any other `Logger[F]`, and see your log events appear in the traces.

## log4cats-natchez-trace-context

Adds the current trace and span IDs to the log context.

This wraps an underlying `LoggerFactory[F]` or `Logger[F]`, so construct those normally,
but don't put them into implicit scope. Instead, wrap those instances with the `TraceContextLoggerFactory[F]`
or `TraceContextLogger[F]` classes and put those wrappers into implicit scope instead.

```scala
given LoggerFactory[IO] = TraceContextLoggerFactory(Slf4jFactory.create[IO])
```
